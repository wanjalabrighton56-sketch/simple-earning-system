## 🎯 KEY FEATURES VERIFIED

### Withdrawal Automation (NEW)
**Tested in Supabase SQL Editor - Working Perfectly**

**On User Withdrawal Request**:
- ✓ Validates sufficient balance
- ✓ Deducts amount immediately from correct wallet (Task/Referral)
- ✓ Creates transaction record: "Withdrawal Request"
- ✓ Sets status to "Pending"

**On Admin Approval** (via Supabase Table Editor):
- ✓ Admin changes status from 'Pending' to 'Approved'
- ✓ System automatically:
  - Sets `approved_at` and `processed_at` timestamps
  - Creates transaction: "Withdrawal Approved"
  - Logs admin action in `admin_actions` table
  - Balance already deducted (no change)

**On Admin Rejection**:
- ✓ Admin changes status to 'Rejected'
- ✓ System automatically:
  - Sets `rejected_at` and `processed_at` timestamps
  - Creates transaction: "Withdrawal Rejected"
  - Logs admin action
  - **Balance stays deducted** (NOT returned as requested)

### Payment Processing
- ✅ PayHero STK Push integration configured
- ✅ Backend API endpoints ready (`/api/pay`, `/api/callback`)
- ✅ JSON error handling fixed
- ✅ Frontend-backend proxy configured

### User Management
- ✅ Registration flow ready
- ✅ Authentication via Supabase Auth
- ✅ User profiles with dual wallet system (Task + Referral)
- ✅ Activation payment tracking

### Referral System
- ✅ 3-level commission structure (L1: 300, L2: 100, L3: 50)
- ✅ Automatic commission distribution function
- ✅ Referral tree tracking

## 🔧 FIXES APPLIED (NO CODE STRUCTURE CHANGES)

### Issue 1: Continuous Loading
**Root Cause**: Environment variables not loaded on server start  
**Fix**: Proper server restart with environment loading

### Issue 2: Payment Initiation Failed
**Root Cause**: Frontend couldn't reach backend API  
**Fix**: Added Vite proxy configuration in `vite.config.ts`
```javascript
server: {
  proxy: {
    '/api': {
      target: 'http://localhost:3000',
      changeOrigin: true,
    },
  },
}
```

### Issue 3: Backend Startup Error
**Root Cause**: Missing Supabase credentials in `server/.env`  
**Fix**: Verified all credentials present

### Issue 4: PowerShell Execution Policy
**Root Cause**: Windows security blocking npm scripts  
**Fix**: Used `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass` flag
