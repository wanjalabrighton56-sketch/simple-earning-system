# IMMEDIATE FIX FOR CONTINUOUS LOADING

## Root Cause
The app is stuck loading because **Row Level Security (RLS) policies** are blocking the initial authentication check. The app tries to read `user_profiles` but gets blocked.

## Solution
Apply the RLS policy fix to Supabase:

### Step 1: Open Supabase SQL Editor
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/ujvtfrdkyflptxknmpma
2. Click: **SQL Editor** (left sidebar)
3. Click: **New Query**

### Step 2: Run This SQL
Copy and paste the entire contents of:
```
supabase/migrations/20251023200000_fix_rls_policies.sql
```

Click **Run** (or Ctrl+Enter)

### Step 3: Restart Frontend
After SQL succeeds:
```powershell
# Stop frontend (Ctrl+C in terminal)
cd e:\project-bolt-sb1-rvxshslo\project
npm run dev
```

### Step 4: Hard Refresh Browser
Press **Ctrl+Shift+R** or **Ctrl+F5**

## What This Fixes
- ✅ Allows authenticated users to read their own profiles
- ✅ Allows users to create/read their own transactions
- ✅ Allows users to create/read their own withdrawals
- ✅ Keeps service role (backend) with full access
- ✅ Maintains security (users can only see their own data)

## Expected Result
After applying:
- ❌ No more continuous loading
- ✅ App loads to registration page (if not logged in)
- ✅ App loads to dashboard (if logged in and activated)
- ✅ App loads to payment page (if logged in but not activated)

## If Still Loading After Fix
Check browser console (F12 → Console) for specific error message and share it.
